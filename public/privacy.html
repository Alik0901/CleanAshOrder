We use Content Posting API to automate publishing of prepared video content
from our content pipeline to TikTok accounts. 
The videos are pre-rendered with captions, subtitles, and audio, then scheduled 
in our database. The app uploads the video via /video/upload and publishes 
via /video/publish. Scope user.info.basic is used only to get the user ID 
to post content. No other personal data is processed.
